  abstract = {`The Problem with\ldots ' series covers controversial topics related to efforts to improve healthcare quality, including widely recommended but deceptively difficult strategies for improvement and pervasive problems that seem to resist solution.Many healthcare organisations now track a number of performance measures like infection and complication rates, waiting times, staff adherence to guidelines, etc. Our own organisation, The Capital Region of Denmark, provides healthcare for 1.7 million people and runs 6 hospitals and 11 mental health centres. Measures of clinical quality have been widely used in our region locally at hospitals and departments for many years. Recently, our region started to systematically define and track strategical key performance measures also at the top management level. Approximately 25 measures on a wide range of subjects from hospital infections to public transportation are being tracked by the top management and the Regional Council.The measurement strategy for hospitals involves a bottom\textendash up approach allowing each hospital and department to, if needed, define its own performance measures that feed into one or more of the overall measures. For example, bacteraemia is one of the overall measures, and some acute-care departments, who rarely see hospital-acquired bacteraemia, have started to work on reducing the use of bladder catheters in order to reduce the risk of bacteraemia from catheter-related urinary tract infections diagnosed after their patients have been transferred to other departments. To support their work, they have developed a handful of measures that track the use of catheters and staff compliance with standard procedures related to catheter use.We welcome this development very much. The choice of relatively few overall measures combined with the bottom\textendash up approach is a helpful strategy that focuses and aligns improvement work and stimulates the use of data at all levels of the organisation while leaving room for meaningful local adaptations of performance \ldots}

In a simulated example, construction of a control chart based upon a geometric distribution reduces the false alarm rate from 9.6\% to 0.9\%. In conclusion, two examples illustrating the applicability of these charts are presented.}

Inherent in those assumptions is the further assumption that the ?parameter? (mean) of the distribution is constant over time. In real applications, this is not always true (some days it rains and some days it does not). This is especially noticeable when the subgroup sizes are very large. Until now, the solution has been to treat the observations as variables in an individual's chart. Unfortunately, this produces flat control limits even if the subgroup sizes vary. This article presents a new tool, the p?-chart, which solves that problem. In fact, it is a universal technique that is applicable whether the parameter is stable or not.}

An essential factor in this success has been the use of Walter A Shewhart's pioneering work in the economic control of variation, which culminated in the development of a simple yet powerful graphical method known as the control chart. This chart classifies variation as having a common cause or special cause and thus guides the user to the most appropriate action to effect improvement. Using six case studies, including the excess deaths after paediatric cardiac surgery seen in Bristol, UK, and the activities of general practitioner turned murderer Harold Shipman, we show a central role for Shewhart's approach in turning the rhetoric of clinical governance into a reality.}

A key aspect of continuous improvement is the measurement, analysis, and interpretation of variation. Consider, for example, the data in table 1 which shows surgeon specific mortality rates after colorectal cancer surgery.1 Ranking the mortality rates or the adjusted hazard ratios, with or without statistical tests, invites the interpretation that some surgeons are better than others. Furthermore, since a hazard ratio of 1 is defined as neutral, surgeons with a hazard ratio above 1 are considered a hazard to their patients. So, by categorising the hazard ratio as either acceptable or unacceptable, the study concludes that ``some surgeons perform less than optimal surgery; some are less competent technically than their colleagues\ldots '' To improve outcomes the next logical step is to stop the less competent surgeons from operating and transfer their patients to the more competent surgeons. Surprisingly, perhaps, there is another way of analysing these data using statistical process control (SPC) which leads to very different conclusions.View this table:In this windowIn a new window Table 1 Surgeon specific mortality rates following colorectal cancer surgery In the 1920s Walter A Shewhart, a physicist, was charged with improving the quality of telephones in Bell Laboratories, USA. His work there won him the accolade of the ``father of modern quality control''.2 Shewhart developed a theory of variation3 which forms the basis of SPC. His theory is easily illustrated. Consider the first five ``QSHC'' signatures in fig 1. Two important observations can be made: (1) despite being produced by the same process, they show variation; and (2) the variation is controlled\textemdash it lies within certain limits.

Overdispersion is not new to the general SPC literature,4\textendash 6 but it has been highlighted recently in healthcare applications of SPC by Spiegelhalter.3 Spiegelhalter explored a number of possible statistical and non-statistical strategies for dealing with overdispersion, favouring on balance a random effects modelling approach. We wish to highlight another approach to handling overdispersion which was developed by Laney.6 We illustrate this approach by using the proportion of emergency readmissions following live discharge data for 2002 from the NHS Performance Ratings dataset.7 In SPC the conventional control chart for handling a time sequence of proportions is the p-chart. Laney showed how to measure and correct for overdispersion \ldots}

  abstract = {The use of statistical process control (SPC) charts in healthcare is increasing. The general advice when plotting SPC charts is to begin by selecting the right chart. This advice, in the case of attribute data, may be limiting our insights into the underlying process and consequently be potentially misleading. Given the general lack of awareness that additional insights may be obtained by using more than one SPC chart, there is a need to review this issue and make some recommendations. Under purely common cause variation the control limits on the xmr-chart and traditional attribute charts (eg, p-chart, c-chart, u-chart) will be in close agreement, indicating that the observed variation (xmr-chart) is consistent with the underlying Binomial model (p-chart) or Poisson model (c-chart, u-chart). However, when there is a material difference between the limits from the xmr-chart and the attribute chart then this also constitutes a signal of an underlying systematic special cause of variation. We use one simulation and two case studies to demonstrate these ideas and show the utility of plotting the SPC chart for attribute data alongside an xmr-chart. We conclude that the combined use of attribute charts and xmr-charts, which requires little additional effort, is a useful strategy because it is less likely to mislead us and more likely to give us the insight to do the right thing.}

Five of the leading statistics are examined?those often labelled D, W 2, V, U 2, A 2?and three important situations: where the hypothesized distribution F(x) is completely specified and where F(x) represents the normal or exponential distribution with one or more parameters to be estimated from the data. EDF statistics are easily calculated, and the tests require only one line of significance points for each situation. They are also shown to be competitive in terms of power.}

Data were extracted on study design, clinical condition or disease being monitored, clinical variable or marker, measurement method, outcome measure and any changes in clinical indicator identified in the articles.Control charts were applied to four conditions\textemdash hypertension, asthma, renal function post-transplant and diabetes. Studies fell into two categories. Three studies sought to determine the `performance' of control charts in comparison with existing `gold standard methods' in terms of sensitivity and specificity based on moderate sample sizes (n = 35\textendash 45). This category of studies found control charts to be simple, low-cost, effective tools with good sensitivity and specificity characteristics and concluded in favour of control charts. The other four studies were individual patient case-studies in which the use of control charts to monitor clinical variables was associated with a positive impact on patient and carer experience albeit anecdotally and with varying degrees of attention.Control charts appear to have a promising but largely under-researched role in monitoring clinical variables in individual patients. Furthermore, rigorous evaluation of control charts is required.}
